# The First Blog Post You Should Read about Gaussian Processes
An interactive introduction to Gaussian Process Regression

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started is to open `Intro_to_Gaussian_Process_Regression.ipynb` and then click the `Open in Colab` button at the top of the notebook.

You can also run locally by cloning this repository, installing the requirements using either `pip`+`virtualenv` or `poetry` and then running `jupyter lab` in the root directory of this repository.


## Purpose

After spending a long time before finally feeling like I had gotten a good idea of GP regression, I felt I could have learned it more quickly with a more gradual and interactive introduction. This is my attempt to provide that for others.
